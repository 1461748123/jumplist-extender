# Jumplist Extender

Jumplist Extender is an easy-to-use program that lets you add custom jump lists to any of your programs on Windows 7!

**(NEW [Version 0.4](http://code.google.com/p/jumplist-extender/downloads/detail?name=JumplistExtender_v0.4.exe)! - 3/31/2011)**

**ATTENTION NON-ENGLISH USERS:** Please download the new v0.4 update. Jumplist Extender should now work and create new jump lists on your system. Sorry for the delay.

**PLEASE CONSIDER DONATING!** Jumplist Extender took a lot of hard work, and you can help me make it better. I appreciate your help!

## With Jumplist Extender, you can:

### Add your own Program Tasks

**You can add any action you want on your jumplist,** provided it has a keyboard shortcut to your program. Make easy-to-access jumplist items for your everyday tasks! **(Works with command line switches, too!)**

### Pin Any Type of File

**Add ANY file and ANY folder to your jumplist** -- and even rename them on the list! Windows only allows you to add files assigned to (or "openable by") the program -- Extender bypasses that limitation.

### Create Extensions to your Programs

Use AutoHotKey scripting to **extend and add functionality to your programs, easily accessible from your own jumplist!** Add a "Save to Desktop Notes" function to Notepad, or add "Snip and upload to ImageShack" to Snipping Tool!

### Share your Jumplists with Others

Export and import your jumplists into **"Jumplist Packs"**! Upload your Jumplist Pack to the web, and **enable others to download and enjoy your work!**
